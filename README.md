# Code-refactor

## Description

The motivation for this project came from within me, as I wanted to prove to myself that I could edit some starter code and form it into a desired mockup. I built this project because I could show that I can produce a desired outcome of a project for someone that asks. A more polished version of this web page could help brands market themselves better and give them tips or even resources to help generate money or popularity. This project taught me how to debug, and the process of getting stuck on some parts, such as why some links in the navigation bar were working and one was not.
